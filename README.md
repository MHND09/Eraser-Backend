# Smart Whiteboard Eraser System

## Technical Overview
The Smart Whiteboard Eraser System is an IoT-based automation solution designed to streamline the whiteboard management process in educational and corporate environments. The system consists of a Raspberry Pi-controlled dual stepper motor mechanism that physically erases whiteboard content while providing advanced features including automated image capture, cloud storage, and scheduled operations.

This comprehensive system integrates hardware control with cloud services through a modular Python architecture,

## System Architecture

### Hardware Architecture
The system is built around the following hardware components:

#### Computational Core
- **Raspberry Pi**: Serves as the central processing unit, handling GPIO control, networking, and orchestration of all system operations.

#### Motor Control System
- **Dual Stepper Motors**: Configured in parallel on the X-axis with an 8-step sequence control pattern.
- **Motor Control Pins**:
  - Motor 1: GPIO pins 8, 10, 22, 3
  - Motor 2: GPIO pins 16, 18, 15, 13
- **Motion Control Algorithm**: Implements half-stepping sequence for precise positioning and smoother movement:
  ```
  [1,0,0,0], [1,1,0,0], [0,1,0,0], [0,1,1,0],
  [0,0,1,0], [0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,1], [1,0,0,1]
  ```

#### Input/Output Peripherals
- **Camera Module**: Supports multiple camera implementations:
  - FSWebcam (default): Configured at 1280x720 resolution
  - PyGame Camera: Alternative implementation for testing environments
- **Physical Interface**:
  - **Control Buttons**:
    - Start/Pause/Resume (GPIO 37)
    - Reset (GPIO 35)
    - Session Toggle (GPIO 33)
  - **Status LED** (GPIO 31): Visual indicator for system state

#### WebApp
#### Dashboard Admin Website
The system includes a web-based dashboard for remote control and monitoring of the whiteboard eraser. The dashboard provides the following features:

- **Real-Time Control**:
   - Execute MQTT commands such as `capture`, `erase`, and `status` directly from the web interface.
   - Toggle session states and manage motor operations remotely.

- **Data Visualization**:
   - Display session data retrieved from the Supabase database.
   - View captured whiteboard images and metadata.

- **Scheduler Management**:
   - Configure and manage automated tasks such as scheduled captures and erasures.
   - Enable or disable schedules dynamically.

- **System Monitoring**:
   - View real-time system status updates via MQTT.
   - Monitor logs and error reports for troubleshooting.
   The dashboard is built using modern web technologies, including Vite.js. It communicates with the system through MQTT and Supabase APIs for seamless integration.

## System Operation

### Initialization Sequence
1. Load configuration from `config.py`
2. Initialize hardware interfaces:
   - Set up GPIO pins for motors, buttons, and LEDs
   - Initialize camera module
3. Establish cloud connections:
   - Connect to MQTT broker
   - Authenticate with Supabase
   - Verify Google Drive credentials
4. Start background services:
   - Task scheduler
   - Upload queue processor
   - Button event listeners
   - MQTT subscription handlers

### Operation Flow
1. **Manual Operation**:
   - User presses physical button or sends MQTT command
   - System executes requested action (capture, erase, etc.)
   - Status updates published to MQTT and database

2. **Scheduled Operation**:
   - Scheduler polls database for scheduled tasks
   - At scheduled time, system executes configured action
   - Results and logs published to cloud services

3. **Image Capture and Processing**:
   - Camera captures image at specified resolution
   - Image saved temporarily to local filesystem
   - Image metadata recorded and added to upload queue

4. **Motor Operation**:
   - Motors receive step sequence commands
   - Position tracking maintained throughout operation
   - Safety checks prevent collisions and overruns

### Failsafe Mechanisms
- **Network Interruption Handling**:
  - Local queuing of captured images (images captured are saved in /queue and are picked up from there and deleted after upload)
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - Session state persistence

- **Power Failure Recovery**:
  - Non-volatile storage of system state (this garantees that the uploader picks up images which had issues uploading in the last run )
  - Graceful initialization after power restoration

- **Error Handling**:
  - Comprehensive logging with severity levels
  - Remote error reporting via MQTT
  - Automatic system recovery attempts

## Advanced Technical Features
